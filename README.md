## The Plan
Since Discord has (finally) decided to add a native AMOLED mode, the purpose of this theme is almost pointless when it rolls out. However, at least in my opinion, their AMOLED could be darker and cover more area. Not much will really change from v3 besides improvements and the ability to adjust the lightness (which will be later on since this isn't even finalized yet). This is just a temporary place to gather some feedback.

Also, last time I worked on this, I stated I would be moving AMOLED-cord to an entirely new repo. I have since then decided.. that's insanely pointless and would cause too much confusion. Once the time comes, this will be merged into the main AMOLED-Cord repo.

**You will 100% have to redownload the main theme when this happens and I will make sure to tell everyone that.**

## Feedback
Even tho you will be able to adjust the brightness, I still want the defaults to be good for most cases so people won't have to do that. If you are giving feedback with the defaults, please let me know what screen type you're on (this is especially important for those using an OLED display).

You currently are not able to adjust brightness, I'm using the variables that Discord provides by default for now since that's the easiest testing environment for me.

Stylus users are unable to test this atm since I'm lazy. If you're using BD, you can save the theme file from [here](./clients/bd/amoled-cord.theme.css).
